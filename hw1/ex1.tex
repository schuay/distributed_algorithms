Hint: For the synchronous case, prove that during round t + 1, a processor at
height t sends a message to its parent. For the asynchronous case, prove that
by time t, a processor at height t has sent a message to its parent.

First, some notation: in this exercise, we consider a distributed system of $n$
processors $\Pi=\{p_0,\dots,p_{n-1}\}$ together with a given spanning tree of depth
$d$ rooted at processor $p_r$. The function
$\text{parent}: \Pi \rightarrow \Pi \cup \{ \text{null} \}$ returns the parent node
within the spanning tree (or null for $p_r$), while each node's depth is given by
$\text{depth}: \Pi \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$.

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:1sync}
In a synchronous distributed system with a given rooted spanning tree executing the convergecast
algorithm, every processor at depth $t$ sends a message to its parent during round $t + 1$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By induction. This lemma holds for $t = 0$ by the description of the algorithm,
since all leaf nodes $x$ send a message to $\prnt{x}$.

Assume the lemma holds for $t \leq n$, and consider an arbitrary node $x$ at depth
$n + 1$. By the definition of the depth function, all child nodes of $x$ must be at
a depth $\leq n$, and by the inductive hypothesis must have sent a message to
$x$ in round $n + 1$ or earlier.

Since this is a synchronous system, these will be available
to $x$ at the latest in round $n + 2$. By the definition of the
convergecast algorithm it then computes the maximum over all received values and
sends the resulting value to $\prnt{x}$ in round $n + 2$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
In a synchronous distributed system with a given rooted spanning tree of depth $d$, the time
complexity of the convergecast algorithm is $d + 1$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Convergecast terminates once $p_r$ has received a message from all of its children.
$\dpth{p_r} = d$ implies that the depth of all child nodes of $p_r$ must be
$\leq d - 1$, with equality holding for at least one child. By lemma \ref{lemma:1sync},
every child must have sent a message to $p_r$ at the latest by round $d$. In round
$d + 1$, $p_r$ has received a message from all child nodes and the algorithm terminates.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:1async}
In an asynchronous distributed system with a given rooted spanning tree executing the convergecast
algorithm, every processor at depth $t$ sends a message to its parent by time $t$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By induction. This lemma holds for $t = 0$ by the description of the algorithm,
since all leaf nodes $x$ send a message to $\prnt{x}$.

Assume the lemma holds for $t \leq n$, and consider an arbitrary node $x$ at depth
$n + 1$. By the definition of the depth function, all child nodes of $x$ must be at
a depth $\leq n$, and by the inductive hypothesis must have sent a message to
$x$ at time $n$ or earlier. 
The maximal message delay is normalized, therefore all messages sent at time $n$
must be processed by time $n + 1$.

This implies that $x$ must have received
a message from all children at time $n + 1$. By the definition of the
convergecast algorithm it then computes the maximum over all received values and
sends the resulting value to $\prnt{x}$ at time $n + 1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
In an asynchronous distributed system with a given rooted spanning tree of depth $d$, the time
complexity of the convergecast algorithm is $d + 1$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Convergecast terminates once $p_r$ has received a message from all of its children.
$\dpth{p_r} = d$ implies that the depth of all child nodes of $p_r$ must be
$\leq d - 1$, with equality holding for at least one child. By lemma \ref{lemma:1async},
every child must have sent a message to $p_r$ at the latest by time $d - 1$. At time
$d$, $p_r$ has received a message from all child nodes and the algorithm terminates.
\end{proof}

\begin{Exc}{(A2.3.v0, 9 points):}
Consider a synchronous distributed system of $n$ processors
$\Pi=\{p_0,\dots,p_{n-1}\}$, connected via a tree of depth $D\geq0$
rooted at processor $p_0$. For simplicity, assume that there is
one additional processor $p_{sink}$ above $p_0$, connected via a single link
$(p_0,p_{sink})$, which just consumes every message sent by $p_0$.
Assume that every processor $p_i\in\Pi$ has
some data $D_i^k$ available at the beginning of every round $k\geq 1$;
for simplicity, assume that $D_i^k$ is already available in the
computing step terminating the previous round $k-1$ (resp.\
in the initial configuration for $k=1$).

Solve the following tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)] Devise a distributed algorithm, which, for every $k\geq 1$,
lets $p_0$ send a single message $M^k$ containing the set
$\{D_i^k| i\in\Pi\}$ to $p_{sink}$ in
round $k+X$, for some fixed $X$ (that may depend on $D$, though).
If needed, you may assume that every processor $p_i$ knows its
height $h_i$ (= its level measured from the bottom leaves;
the height of a chain of $D$ processors is hence $D-1$, for example) in
the tree. Provide a sound proof that it indeed achieves its
goal.

\item[(2)] Assuming that every $D_i^k$ requires $B$ bits,
give the total bit
complexity (taken over all messages containing data relevant for
$M^k$) for generating $M^k$, and the local memory requirement
(without $\inbuf_i[*]$, $\outbuf_i[*]$ and round number) for $p_i$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{Exc}

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Tree Pipeline} \label{alg:tpipe}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State \textcolor{Gray}{Code for processor $p_i, 0 \leq i \leq n - 1$}
\State Initially, $h(p_i)$ stores $p_i$'s height, and $msgs = \{ D_i^1, D_i^2, \ldots \}$
\For{each round $t$}
    \State $msgs \gets msgs \cup \text{the set of all received messages}$

    \If{$k = t - h(p_i) > 0$}
        \State Remove all $D_*^k$ from $msgs$ and send them to parent
    \EndIf
\EndFor
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Essentially, each node waits until it has all $D_*^k$ messages and
then forwards them to its parent, using $msgs$ as temporary storage.

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:tpipe}
In round $k + D$, the root node $p_0$ of a tree of diameter $D$
stores the set of all $D_*^k$ messages in its $msgs$ variable.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Induction on the diameter $D$.

The base case is a tree with $D = 0$ consisting of a single node $p_0$. Since $msgs$
is initialized to contain the set of all $D_*^*$, and messages $D_*^k$ are only removed in the
corresponding round $k$,

We now assume that theorem \ref{thm:tpipe} holds for all diameters $\leq D - 1$,
and show that the theorem follows for diameter $D$. The root of a tree with diameter $D$
can be interpreted as $p_{sink}$ of all subtrees rooted at its child nodes. Each of these subtrees
is of diameter $\leq D - 1$, and by the induction hypothesis it follows that $p_0$
receives all $D_*^k$ messages of all subtrees at the latest in round $k + D$.
\end{proof}

\begin{Exc}{(W2.1.v0, 9 points):}
Consider a distributed system of $n$ processors, in a
connected (but not necessarily fully connected) network $G$.
Assume that every $p_i$ has
an array $\neighbors_i[*]$ that gives its neighbor processors,
sorted according to decreasing communication link quality.
For example, in a wireless setting, it could be sorted according
to increasing Euclidean distance between $p_i$ and its neighbors.
Let this quality of the communication link $(p_i,p_j)$ be
denoted as $|(p_i,p_j)|=|(p_j,p_i)|$, which we assume to be (slightly)
different from any other $|(p_x,p_y)|$ for simplicity, and let
the corresponding order $<_i$
of the neighbors of $p_i$ be defined as
$p_j=\neighbors_i[k] <_i p_\ell=\neighbors_i[m]$ iff $k<m$ (which
implies $|(p_i,p_j)|<|(p_i,p_\ell)|$).

Consider the following asynchronous distributed algorithm, which constructs
a less dense communication topology $T$ (not necessarily a spanning
tree like our Algorithm~2, but typically a fairly sparse graph):

\begin{code}%
\vspace*{-1cm}%
\emn{Code for processor $p_i$, $0\leq i \leq n-1$, with given
array $\neighbors_i[*]$}\NL
\emn{$T$ will consist of the edges $(p_i,p_j)$ with $p_j\in N_i$.}\NL
VAR $N_i := \emptyset$ // neighbors to be included\NL
\> $\overline{N}_i := \emptyset$ // neighbors to be excluded\\
\NL
for $k=1$ to $|\neighbors_i[*]|$ do // go over all neighbors\NL
\> $j := \neighbors_i[k]$\NL
\> send message "?" to $p_j$ // ask for $p_j$'s neighbors array\NL
\> receive array $\neighbors_j[*]$ from $p_j$\NL
\> if $\exists p_\ell \in N_i \cup \overline{N}_i$ with $p_\ell <_j p_i$\NL
\>\> $\overline{N}_i := \overline{N}_i \cup \{p_j\}$ // exclude $p_j$\NL
\> else\NL
\>\> $N_i := N_i \cup \{p_j\}$ // include $p_j$\\
\NL
On receiving "?" from $p_j$:\NL
\> send message containing $\neighbors_i[*]$ to $p_j$
\end{code}

Solve the following tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)] Provide the complete translation of this algorithm into the corresponding
transition relation + initial state. Recall that sequential computations can
usually be packed into in a single state transition.

\item[(2)] Prove that the algorithm always constructs $T$ consistently, in
the sense that $p_i$ includes $p_j$ in $N_i$ iff $p_j$ includes $p_i$
in $N_j$.

\item[(3)] For arbitrary (but different) choices of link quality
$|(p_i,p_j)|$, prove that $T$ is connected and that its shortest
cycle has length 4.
\footnote{Whereas this does not imply that $T$ is always sparse,
one could e.g.\ show that the maximum degree of every processor is at
most 6 when the link quality $|(p_i,p_j)|$ is the processors' Euclidean
distance and $G$ is such that if some link $(p_i,p_j)$ is
in $G$, then every shorter link $(p_i,p_\ell)$ with $|(p_i,p_\ell)|
\leq |(p_i,p_j)|$ is also in $G$.}
